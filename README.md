You will most likely need to tell your browser to "load unsafe scripts" for this app to run properly.  

### Overview
* Giftastic is a responsive web app that populates gifs from user created categories, using the GIPHY API.  
* This app takes a value from the user input box and adds it into an array.  
* A function call creates buttons on the page for each topic in this array.  
* When the user clicks on a button 10 static, non-animated gif images are grabbed from the GIPHY API and placed onto the page.  
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate.  
* If the user clicks the gif again, the gif will stop playing.  
* Under every gif is displayed it's corresponding rating.
